## Key info:
This is an site built to practice building out more frontend designs. I plan to also add a backend to it with a simple text editor and blog demo platform to be a fullstack blog demo app.
<br/>
I choose Nextjs to build the project forseveral reasons:
<br/>
-the SEO advantages it offers over pure React.
<br/> 
Also Nextjs provides a strong footing for further development of the application in future, if I start building more of the backend and other services and the app grows in complexity Nextjs offers a strong framework in order to do those things.

**Tech used:** HTML, SASS/CSS, Typescript, Nextjs/Reactjs, Bootstrap


## Optimizations
The frontend of the project is complete, however there are other features that I would like to add in the future to give a little more depth to the project and to set it up to serve as a basic demo of a blogging app
<br/>
I plan in the future to build out the BE by doing the following:
<br/>
[ ] - adding auth for users to sign up to and login to the app
<br/>
[ ] - to add a simple text editor to enable a blogging app demo

## Lessons Learned:
This was the first time I had used Nextjs so was a nice introduction to it. As part of this project and alongside I did a lot of research also into the functionality of Nextjs and have learnt alot about SSR vs CSR vs SSG vs ISR which was very interesting.
<br/>
Also this was the first time I had used Bootstrap, I've experience with other UI frameworks and libraries but had never used Bootstrap. Using it in conjunction with Nextjs presented some issues and good learning opportunities regarding reconfiguring and customising the Bootstrap styles.
